	<h1>"A Hand-Made Wallet"</h1>
	<p>
		An ill child was brought to a hospital. After her treatment, the mother showed the doctor a hand-made wallet and said:
	</p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There are things we can't pay, I hope you take this walles I made for you."</p>

	<p>The doctor said:</p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't practice for sentimental reasons. Pay me P10000."</p>

	<p>The lady opened the wallet, took out P50000 and gave the doctor P10000. Then she replied:</p>

	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "You are a very good doctor but I wish you were a better person."</p>
