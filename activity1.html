    <blockquote style="font-size: 20px;">
        My purpose in life is to live as freely as possible, while also being a loving daughter, 
        supportive friend, and responsible citizen. I strive to use my abilities and skills to 
        help others, just as I have been helped by those around me. Whether through my career, 
        relationships, or personal growth, my goal is to live as freely and authenticaly, 
        making a positive impact on those around me, no matter how big or small.
